This is nucleic acid targeted detection data, including example data and a blank control. The detection was performed using MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry), and the data were processed through background subtraction, smoothing, and peak detection. The processed result images are included, and ultimately, all 22 target sites were successfully identified!
